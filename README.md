# Tictactoe

Project is based on a very popular social game called Tic-Tac-Toe. Game board consists of 9 fields table. Players mark their chosen spots in turns with the main goal to connect 3 fields in one straight line in any direction.

# Installation
In order to run the project locally, you need to install node.js on your machine. Head to the [NODE.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) and download the latest stable version of the program. Install it on your machine.

Node.js is basically a javascript engine very similar to the regular browser one you're using every time you use your web browser. The difference is it has many more functionalities that are not tied to regular browser, but are made for backend part of the app.

You also need mongodb as a backend database provider. Head to the [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas), download atlas and install it on your machine. It should already have the required address in order to create database at the start.

# Backend start
Next, download the code provided on [this link](https://github.com/aleksbn/tictactoe-node), copy it to the location you would like it to be stationed and open up your console.
Go to the folder you copied the project to. In case you need to go a folder up, type:
```
cd ..
```
and in case you need to go down the folder paths, type in:
```
cd \documents\tictactoe
```
This is, of course, just an example of the location we need. If, for any reason, your preffered folder is on another disk, say, disk D, type in
```
d:
```
in order to change path to disk D.

# Installing libraries
By default, most of the projects on github are stored without node_modules folder that consists of many required libraries in order to run the project. In order to download them, type in
```
npm install
```
You should repeat the process of libraries installation for frontend part too.
# Running the app
Simple, just type in 
```
npm start
```
and voila! The app is running on address [http://localhost:3900/](http://localhost:3900/)

# Frontend start, install and running the app
Download the code from this project for the frontend app. The steps are pretty much the same as with backend, and there's no major differences.

# Architecture considerations
Project is using 3 layers:
1. MongoDB (database)
2. Node.js (backend)
3. React (frontend)

# Node.js backend libraries
List of used libraries is following:
1. bcrypt v5.1.1 for hashing passwords
2. config v3.3.9 for configuration settings
3. cors v2.8.5 for configuring policies and allowing frontend to connect to backend
4. express v4.18.2 for creating node.js server
5. joi v17.11.0 for validating data
6. jsonwebtoken v9.0.2 for working with jwt token for authentication
7. lodash v4.17.21 for working with arrays and data structures
8. nodemon v3.0.1 for keeping server live without the need to restart it every time when you change something in files
9. mongoose v8.0.0 for connecting with mongodb database
10. socket.io v4.7.2 for making live communications between players
11. ts-node v3.0.1 for starting the app in typescript mode
12. typescript v5.2.2 for making types being used in the app

# React frontend libraries
List of used libraries is following:
1. axios v0.18.1 for making easier requests to server
2. bootstrap v4.1.1 for styling the app display
3. font-awesome v4.7 for adding new and interesting icons and fonts
4. joi-browser v13.4 for frontend validation
5. jquery v3.7.1 for making navbar responsive
6. jwt-decode v2.2 for decoding jwt token sent from backend
7. lodash v4.17.10 for working with arrays and data structures
8. popper.js v1.16.1 for making navbar responsive
9. react v18.2.0 as the core library for making react apps
10. react-bootstrap v2.9.1 for adding bootstrap to react
11. react-dom v18.2.0 for manipulating DOM with react
12. react-router-dom v4.3.1 for working with routes
13. react+scripts v5.0.1 for working with scripts in react
14. react-toastify v4.1 for making messages more interesting
15. socket.io-client v4.7.2 for live communication between users
16. typescript v4.9.5 for making types being used in the app
17. web-vitals v2.1.4 as a part of react app
